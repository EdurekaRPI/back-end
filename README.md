# Edureka Back-End Repository

## Description
Edureka is an event management and archival tool for 
RPIâ€™s Event Office. The purpose of Edureka is to manage and 
coordinate campus-wide events created using RPI Event Hub and 
Study Compass to ensure one centralized place to find up-to-date 
events. Those with admin access will have the ability to overwrite 
existing events if needed.
